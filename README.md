# Zooplankton Educational Website for ENVS-2001-1 (Spring 2023)
## Outline
1. Introduction
   1. Summarize the importance of zooplankton to the ecosystem.
   2. Explain the purpose of the website to the user: to educate the user about zooplankton and zooplankton populations in an interactive way.
   3. Explain features available on the website.
   4. Invite users to share the website with others.
      1. Provide social media sharing links.
2. Education Points
   1. What is zooplankton? Where are zooplankton? Why is zooplankton important?
   2. Brief descriptions of different types of zooplankton with images.
   3. A brief explanation of how zooplankton populations are measured and monitored.
   4. Describe what environmental factors can affect zooplankton populations and how.
3. Data
   1. Explain the data that the website will use.
   2. Show example data on zooplankton population monitoring from external sources.
   3. Show example graphs of how different environmental factors affect zooplankton.
4. Interactive Features
   1. A short quiz to test users on their knowledge of zooplankton based on information provided on the site.
   2. Simulation/Data visualization that allows users to change factors in a simulated environment to see their effects on zooplankton populations.
5. Resources
   1. Provide links to other sites that have information on zooplankton.
   2. Provide information on how users can get involved with research and conservation efforts about zooplankton.
      1. Call to action to encourage user involvement.
   3. Display images of and statements (quotes) by experts in the field of zooplankton, plus possible contact information, if available.
